### Commit 1 Reflection notes

#### What does `handle_connection` do?

0. We import `std::io::prelude` and `std::io::BufReader` to use features that help in reading from and writing to the network stream.

1. In the `handle_connection` function, mutable reference to the `stream` are wrapped with the help of a new `BufReader` instance.

2. A variable named `http_request` is created to read the incoming request line by line and collect these lines into a vector.

3. If thereâ€™s an error while reading (like invalid data or a problem with the stream), the program stops.

4. The browser signals the end of an HTTP request by sending two newline characters in a row. The function reads lines until it gets an empty line, which signifies the end of the HTTP headers.

5. The function prints out the contents of `http_request`.

#### What does the new `handle_connection` do?

The handle_connection function now reads the contents of an HTML file and includes it in the HTTP response. 

1. Firstly, we prepare an HTTP response. It starts with a status line indicating a successful response (`HTTP/1.1 200 OK`).

2. The `contents` variable reads the contents of the file `hello.html` into a string.

3. After that, we try to get the contents' length, which will be used to set the `Content-Length` header in the HTTP response.

4. The function then creates the full HTTP response. It includes the status line, a Content-Length header indicating the size of the response body, and the contents of `hello.html` as the body of the response.

5. Finally, the function writes the response to the `TcpStream`.
